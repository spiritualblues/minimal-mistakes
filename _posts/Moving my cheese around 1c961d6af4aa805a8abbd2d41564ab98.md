# Moving my cheese around

### I am moving things around. I will be retiring my pagecord blog and moving my root domain to github pages. I will use a landing page at least for now. I will blog at [spi.blue/blog](http://spi.blue/blog) using Jekyll at GitHub pages. The pagecord archive will live at [spi.blue/archive](http://spi.blue/archive). With a little help from chatgpt I am  ensuring that google search traffics sees no broken links. Pagecord was kind enough to let me export out my posts. I am trialing out a medium subscription too. I am incredibly proud of managing all this without a formal technical background. The image has no relationship to the post but I am just going to see if notion > markdown > jekyll work flow works.
